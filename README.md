# Password_Generator
a password generator that, when run will copy the generated password to your clipboard, so there's no need to click anything away.

created with python and uses pyperclip to clip it to your clipboard.

can change the settings within .py to get different results.
the .exe is pre-created using the data as the initial upload of this repository.
you can create your own .exe using pyinstaller, reasoning for this is for a easier run program -> paste generated password.

can expand this project by adding a dynamic way to change the values or have a seperate file it reads the values from in a way to keep the idea of run program -> paste generated password.
many ways you can change it and it's all up to you.
